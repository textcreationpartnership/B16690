            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE ADVANTAGES OF THE TOBACCO TRADE.</head>
            <p n="1">1 IT imploys near two hundred Sail of Ships, from one hundred to five hundred Tuns, and breeds many Marriners.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It Vends vast quantities of English Manufactures and other things for Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Building, Furniture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It pays yearly from one hundred thousand, to one hundred and thirty thousand pounds Custom to the King.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is sent from hence to most parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and thereby Shipping is imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the stock of the Kingdom increased by return of Money and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Inconveniences that will follow, by laying a greater Imposition are,</head>
               <p n="1">1 GReat quantities of Tobacco have been left in Warehouses, for that the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, Freight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are more then oftentimes the Commodity yielded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath been found by experience, that when the duty hath been more, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue was less, and the Custom Books tells us, that His Majesty hath yearly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more at two pence the pound, then in former times when it was higher.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will discourage the Importation, and incourage the defrauding of the Custom, especially in the Out Ports and Creeks.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A new Tax will make it dearer, and so less quantities will be Imported, and will, occasion the cutting of stalks amongst it, which are usually cast away, or sold for little.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As the Tobacco Trade hath of late been managed, it hath drawn the whole almost from other Nations.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It will incourage the planting of Tobacco in <hi>Ireland, Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and put them upon finding out ways to Transport it privately hither to supply the Nation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Importation being less, the Exportation of our Native Manufactures will be so likewise, and many Families that depend upon them, and sitting Tobacco for Sale, will be ruined.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The great Ships built and imployed by the Traders will be laid aside as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and no more built for want of imployment, and so Navigation weakned.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Tobacco will be carried into other Nations where the Duties are less, as <hi>Holland, Zeland, Hambrough,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> where it pays not above one half penny <hi>per pound,</hi> from whence the Planters will be supplyed with all necessaries, or they will be necessitated to leave their own, and go to the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Plantations, where they may find better incouragement.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Necessity will cause the Inhabitants of the Plantations to turn their Lands to the increasing of Provisions, and imploy their hands in making those Manufactures which they have hitherto been supplyed with from <hi>England.</hi> 1685.</p>
